## Flight Prediction Algorithm
##### About 20% of flights are delayed every year, which has resulted in negative experiences as well as lost time and money. To improve customers' experiences, flight delays can be predicted using available data in order to minimise future delays.

#### Objectives:
* Analyse the factors and causes that lead to delays of flights.
* Predict whether a flight will be delayed based on given features with evaluation methods.
